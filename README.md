# What is this?
Basically this tracker is supposed to act like a tile tracker. You can attach it to any object and whenever you drop the object, the accelerometer will pick it up and play a sound and blink lights. It will also notify you in the Arduino app on your smartphone.

Let's say you lost it somewhere, you can also play a sound (we hard-coded daisy bell using individual frequencies) to locate the object. We also CAD-ed and 3D printed a casing for the electrical components.
